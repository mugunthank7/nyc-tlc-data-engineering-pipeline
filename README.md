<h1 align="center">🚖 NYC TLC Data Engineering Pipeline</h1>

<p align="center">
A production-grade, end-to-end data engineering and analytics pipeline built from <b>NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC)</b> trip records.
<br>
This project demonstrates real-world data engineering, dataset cleaning, feature engineering, EDA, statistics, and clustering — structured cleanly for recruiters, data science managers, and portfolio reviewers.

# 🏗️ Project Overview

This project implements a **full-stack data workflow**, including:

- 🕸 **Web Scraping** TLC website for trip record dataset links  
- 🔍 **Intelligent Dataset Selection** (best-coverage year, taxi type, parquet-only)  
- 💾 **Automated Downloading & File Handling**  
- 🧱 **Consolidation** into a unified year-level dataset  
- 🧪 **Deterministic 12K Sample** for reproducible EDA and modeling  
- ⚙️ **Feature Engineering** (duration, speed, hour-of-day, weekday/weekend)  
- 📊 **Advanced EDA** with insights-rich visualizations  
- 📉 **Statistical Modeling** (Regression, ANOVA, Correlation Study)  
- 🤖 **KMeans Clustering** to segment trip behavior  
- 🖼 **Automatic Plot Exports** to `results/plots/`  

This project shows both **Data Engineering** (pipelines, web scraping, dataset processing)  
and **Data Science** (visualization, statistical modeling, clustering).
